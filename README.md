# Privacy Setting Checkboxes
## Dependent click settings

The goal of this project was to create a table of privacy settings. Each row in a table is a specific privacy setting, and you can select how strong you want that privacy setting to be.

A click on an unchecked box is designed to check off the input in every cell to the right of the element, while a click in a checked box will uncheck all the boxes in the table cells to the left of the element.

## To-Do!

* Learn design
* Make it pretty
* Make the privacy settings a DOM element on submit rather than console only
  * Animate that DOM element? Just for kicks?
